ggannotate is a tool to help you put your annotations exactly where you want them to go. 

With ggannotate, you can interactively annotate ggplots using a Shiny-based RStudio add-in.

## Installation

Install from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("mattcowgill/ggannotate")
```

## Usage

There are three ways to use `ggannotate`: 

1. Select some ggplot2 code in RStudio, then invoke the `ggannotate` addin via RStudio's Addins menu.

2. Create a ggplot2 object, then call `ggannotate()`, like this:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, 
            aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point() 

ggannotate::ggannotate(p)
```

3. Wrap some code that creates a ggplot2 object in `ggannotate()`, like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggannotate::ggannotate(ggplot(mtcars, 
                              aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
                         geom_point())
```

Each of these options will launch a Shiny app. Choose what type of annotation you want, click to place it in the right place, and click 'copy code' to copy the annotation code to the clipboard. Then paste the copied code in your script and you're done!

You can adjust the size of the plot in the Shiny app so you can set it to be the same as your intended output. You can keep repeat the process to add multiple annotations (this will get easier in later versions.)
